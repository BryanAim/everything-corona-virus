										<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>Myth</th>
												<th>Fact</th>
											</tr>
										</thead>
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>Being exposed to hot temperatures prevents the coronavirus disease</td>
												<td>Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Consuming Eggs And Chicken Spreads COVID-19</td>
												<td> Scientists are yet to discover if there is any relation between the two.

													However, avoid eating animals that have died of any disease. </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>After Being infected, one cannot recover from the disease</td>
												<td> You can recover from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Catching the new coronavirus DOES NOT mean you will have it for life.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Holding your breath for 10 or more seconds means you are free from COVID-19</td>
												<td>The best way to confirm if you have  the virus producing COVID-19 disease is with a laboratory test.  You cannot confirm it with this breathing exercise, which can even be dangerous.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Products Coming From China Can Infect You</td>
												<td>This virus cannot last long on packages and letters so it is safe to use products from China, says WHO.
													However, in case you still fear, sanitize the product before using it. </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>It Be Transmitted Through Mosquito Bites</td>
												<td>There is no evidence that supports the theory that mosquito bites can spread coronavirus. </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Lab In Wuhan Created The Outbreak</td>
												<td>As the number of cases increased, a rumor started that a Chinese lab near the Wuhan market was working on a secret bioweapon that accidentally got leaked and led to this. However, this ain't true. </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Hand Dryers Can Effectively Kill The Virus</td>
												<td>Hand dryers are not effective in killing COVID-19. The only use of dryers here is to dry your hands after washing your hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer. </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Bat Soup/Snakes Started The Virus</td>
												<td>Remember that video of a Chinese woman consuming bat soup that went viral claiming Covid-19 spreads through bats? Well, it's almost a four-year-old video. It's true that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was passed on from bats but nothing links bats or snakes to the virus yet. </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Would Vaccination Help?</td>
												<td>No cure or vaccination has been developed for it, yet. Scientists and researchers are still working towards it. Though no vaccination will cure you of coronavirus, a vaccine against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Pets Can Spread The Disease</td>
												<td>WHO has stated that dogs cannot contain or transmit this disease as with the cows and birds are also immune to this disease.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Consuming Garlic and Onion</td>
												<td>Garlic is healthy food and studies claim it has antimicrobial properties that help in building your immunity. But nothing proves that eating garlic or onion can cure this outbreak. </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Elderly And Children More Prone To The Virus</td>
												<td>The virus is not age specific. It can happen to anyone and everyone. However, older people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease) are more vulnerable to it.  </td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Vitamin C Helps Cure The Virus</td>
												<td>Vitamin C is a great supplement to build immunity but nothing proves that it can cure the virus. There is no medicine or treatment launched yet. </td>
											</tr>
												<tr>
												<td> Corona Beer Leads To Coronavirus</td>
												<td>Well, this proves the Internet is indeed a funny place. Corona beer cannot infect you. The only similarity the two share, is the term “Corona”. </td>
											</tr>
